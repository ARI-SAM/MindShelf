# 👋 Welcome to MindShelf!

Hi there! This is **MindShelf**, my personal note-taking application. 

It's built with a **React** frontend and a **Node.js/Express** backend.

### ✨ What can you do here?
- **📝 Take Notes**: Jot down your thoughts instantly.
- **🔗 Add Links**: Save important URLs (just click the link icon!).
- **📎 Attach Files**: Upload images or PDFs to keep everything together.
- **🎨 Beautiful UI**: Enjoy a "neumorphic" design with custom color themes (Airy Blue inputs & Warm Physical notes).

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. Go to `backend` and run `npm start` (or `npm run dev`).
2. Go to `frontend` and run `npm run dev`.
3. Open your browser and start organizing your mind!

Happy taking notes! 🚀
